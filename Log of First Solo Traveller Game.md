# Finding a Patron
page 25 of [patrons](file:///home/curtis/Desktop/RPG/Traveller/Books/ClassicTravellerLBB_3.pdf)
It took 2 months (8 search 1d6 rolls that cover one week each.)
The patron reaction 2d6 roll was a 10, which gave a positive reaction, so Fred was hired.  I should do a some kind of haggling roll to see what Fred is payed.
## Pedro the Patron
Pedro is a professional arsonist who has a contract on Cyan to set a fire in a factory.  He has a (stolen) ship, but his usual pilot is ill.
