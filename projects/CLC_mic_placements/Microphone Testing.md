# Goals
- test various microphone placements to give a better overall sound for choir over the streaming feed
	- The sound of choir in the sanctuary seems fine as-is, so just concentrate on the stream
	- This makes things easier, since we won't have to deal with feedback issues from the speakers in the sanctuary
- We want tests that can easily be run during choir rehearsals
	- No one has time or focus left over to listen during rehearsals, so we'll need to record the rehearsals with different arrangements of mics, and listen to them later
- There are two tall mic stands in the mic closet by side sanctuary entry door that can be used.
- If we can find spare cables, we can just disconnect choir mics, move them to the spare stands and spare cables without changing the regular cabling stand setup, and then move them back at the end of rehearsal.
