## old seed/gen phrases
* two tan and black cats (one long hair, one short hair) sitting on an ironing board that flies through the air.
* two tabbie cats (one long hair, one short hair) sitting on an ironing board, shown from below and the side.


## Latest seed/gen phrase

Two calico cats in profile(both tan, white and black).  Both are sitting on an ironing board looking over the front of the board.
