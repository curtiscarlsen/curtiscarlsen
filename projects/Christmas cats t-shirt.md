# Creating artwork for the shirts

## nightcafe allows 5 pictures per day, I can try to dial something in before CC

picture of the christmas cats (started gen'ing the pic with dall-e-2 web site, ran out of credit on free account.  No new credits until July 23d, way too late for comic con):

### old seed/gen phrases
* two tan and black cats (one long hair, one short hair) sitting on an ironing board that flies through the air.
* two tabbie cats (one long hair, one short hair) sitting on an ironing board, shown from below and the side.


### Latest seed/gen phrase

Two calico cats in profile(both tan, white and black).  Both are sitting on an ironing board looking over the front of the board.
