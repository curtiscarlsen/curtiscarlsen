## Finding a Patron
Patrons are a specific type of NPC, see encounters in LBB3 p25.  The search for a patron takes 1 week, and 1d6 is thrown.  On 5 or 6 a patron is found.
It took two months for Fred to find a patron (8th roll).
D66 roll was 11 which means patron is an Arsonist. (from Patron Encounters table on P27)
