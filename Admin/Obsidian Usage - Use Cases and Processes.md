# Task/Chores lists

## Use the Tasks plugin
- Scatter the tasks around in various notes, the tasks plugin will scan for them and aggregate them in filtered summary lists using code blocks.
- The summary lists allow editing the tasks and marking them complete right from the summary list, it also gives links so you can jump to the task's definition so that you can update any context info around the task as needed.
- A task definition must be a line on it's own, no text in the line before or after the definition
- Tasks can be distributed among notes of pretty much any type.  No need to manually create lists.  It is possible to do so, but unnecessary.  For convenience, tasks could be put into kanban boards to make the ordering and status handling of those tasks intuitively obvious at a glance without code blocks, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort.
	- **Note: Kanban entries in the gui mode screen do no support any of the task dates (start, due, schedule, etc) of the tasks plugin.  But if you switch to markdown mode in the kanban you can set the tasks dates.**
	- Note: KanBan can be switched over to markup mode, in which case the individual kanban cards are listed as their underlying markdown check-boxes, which are the same as the task definitions in tasks plugin.  This means that tasks automatically detects kanban cards as tasks, and also, in markdown mode one can trivially cut and paste a task definition from any other note straight into the kanban, thus allowing managing any task in the kanban while deleting the previous definition to avoid duplicates.  Might want to put a link back to the original source note in the def'n to maintain a link with the context info that was originally around the task def'n.
