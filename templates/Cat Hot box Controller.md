The first two cat hot box temp controllers are W1209 boards.  That board comes with thermistor, and uses a DC12V supply.  long hold of the left button accesses registers.  P0 is heater/cooler selection.  P6 is the alarm cutoff function for temperature limit.

ui temp limits are in P2/P3.  I set heat limit to 55 deg C, and heat alarm cutout to 60 deg C on second box.
