* ***It’s Alive, Jim! Evolutionary Biology in “Star Trek:”** Many of the creatures and ideas in comic books are so fantastical it’s impossible to think they could — or do — exist in real life... right? In this panel, Ashley Poust, a paleontologist at the San Diego Natural History Museum, Danielle de Carle, a researcher and lecturer at the University of Toronto and Amanda Jack, a biochemist and biophysicist at SyntheX, examine the creations from the “Star Trek” universe and ponder the possibility that they could exist on Earth. _8 to 9 p.m., Room 28DE_
