All hall the power of Jesus name
Christy be our lights
Blest be the ties
Just as I am
Here I am lord
My life flows on in endless song
All hail the power of Jesus name
Thine the amen
O Christy the same
Soon and very soon
I love to tell the story
We all are one in mission
We are called
Brightest and best of the stars
Soli deo gloria
When in our music god is glorified
Take my life that I may be
How firm a foundation
