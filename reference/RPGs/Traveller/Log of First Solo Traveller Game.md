# Finding a Patron
page 25 of [patrons](file:///home/curtis/Desktop/RPG/Traveller/Books/ClassicTravellerLBB_3.pdf)
It took 2 months (8 search 1d6 rolls that cover one week each.)
The patron reaction 2d6 roll was a 10, which gave a positive reaction, so Fred was hired.  I should do a some kind of haggling roll to see what Fred is payed.
## Pedro the Patron
Pedro is a professional arsonist who has a contract on Cyan to set a fire in a factory.  He has a (stolen) ship, but his usual pilot is ill.
# Getting to a new planet
When the ship drops out of hyper,  the system patrols try to stop them, and the ship has to avoid them by hiding in the asteroid field. Fred uses his pilot skill to attempt to hide from  the patrol through the asteroid field.  That is a success.  There are no multi-roll skill checks that I see in the docs.  The patrol searches for the ship and rolls a 7.  Since tthe ship has some cover in the asteriod field, a roll of more than 8 is required, so the search fails, and our villains slip past.

# Tracking down target
The crew search for a way into the factory to set the fire.  Fred uses his vehicle-3 skill to locate the way. 2d6=5+3 gives a minimal success at 8.  They find a back road into the factory compound.

# Trading
The team needs accelerant for the fire.  They fail on first attempt at buying it.  They succeed 2d6=9, on the second.

# Set the fire
Pedro set the fire: 2d6=9, success.

# Combat
As the team leaves the area, security spots them, and the team has a quick fire fight with them.
* no surprise either side
* team tries to escape, rolled 9 but short range, so dm-1 giving an 8 which fails to escape.
* 
Fred scores a success, wounding the security guard damage d66=35.  The guard shoots pedro.d66 = 66! Pedro is hurt bad.  If one of his stats was under 6, he's unconscious.
Fred shoots guard again, and he goes down.

# Ship Combat
The team gets to the ship and takes off.  As they head out to the jump limit, a patrol ship finds them and takes them by surprise.
the team shoots off sandcasters and runs at top speed, getting to the jump limit before the patrol disables their ship.
