## Traveller version comparisons
* Marc Miller's traveller is considered the worst of the many versions of traveller.  Due to errata and problems in tables in the rulebook.
	* This is the version that Lorri bought back when.
* The latest version is generally considered one of the easiest to start with. (Mongoose publishing, 2022 update, )
