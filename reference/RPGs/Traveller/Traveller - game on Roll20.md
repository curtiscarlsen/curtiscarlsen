## video panes

* Need camera for DM and a pane for map 
	* DM link for roll 20 Trav1 game: 
		* [[https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/search]]
		* To log in as player instead of DM, log out of roll20 and log back in as lcarlsen@san .rr.com.  That account has an invite as player to the game.
	* Roll20 audio/video does not work on mobiles, so we probably will need to run a discord server.
## Game Flow
* Design Adventure
* First session
	* Character Design
	* Set Starting Scene
