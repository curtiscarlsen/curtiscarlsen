# Background
Classic Traveller was written in the 70's.  The rulebooks are laid out in semi-random fashion.  There is very little detail on game mechanics, and no good way to find where in the books you need to go to read rules that affect a specific scenario.  Organization is almost nil.  Get used to it.
# Skills
All skills are handled uniquely.  You really need to read the skill description carefully.
