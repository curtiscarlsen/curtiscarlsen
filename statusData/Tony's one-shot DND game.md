Shael can have an epiphany seeing everyone hurt and wanting to finish off the quest.

try to get the kid to go tell his father about the shrooms of wailing (not a banshee), that the thief appears to be dead in the tower, batilda is gravely injured, and the two adventurers are working to retrieve the taxes and clear out the shrooms.

see if there is any kind of healing Shael can apply to batilda(?)

*make something to snag tentacles, and then use trapped tentacle to drag each shroom out into corridor.*

earplugs

build barriers the width and height of the corridor out of branches, then make spears longer than the tentacles.

make a moving shelter that one PC can move around under that would hold out tentacles.  (for when they move into room to finish off last of the shrooms.)

make barbed things to hook into shrooms so we can drag them into corridor and whack at them one at a time.
