2 separate issues

Patient initially seen by the hospice team February 2023

Patient's only qualify for hospice if physician thinks they will pass on within 6 months which certainly does not seem to be the case at this point

Whether or not she is on or off hospice does not necessarily have anything to do with whether she is bedridden

For example, a patient can be bedridden for their entire adult life if they had a spinal cord injury when they were child

Need additional information:  

Currently is Valerie walking or nonambulatory ?

If nonambulatory does she spend all her time in bed worse he also up to chair or wheelchair during the day  ( and if so does she need assistance to get into chair or wheelchair) ?

Please forward information back to me.

Contact me if any questions.'
